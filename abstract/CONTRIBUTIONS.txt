Jo Mama: largely made lensing.py and processImg.py, which take in the initial image and then, after calling the integrator function from projFuncs, determine the pixel values for each pixel of the final image, and then spit out/save the final image. Also expanded the functions for converting between spherical and cartesian coordinates to convert between velocities in addition to positions. 

Ethan Pham: Responsible for most pf projFuncs.py:
- RK4 with dynamic timestepping (using a special case of richardson extrapolation)
- The integrator for the equations of motion for light geodesics around the Schwarchild black hole
- The positional conversion between cartesian and spherical coordinates
- Added video function for moving perspective
- Parallelized the code (via frame calculation)
Also responsible for photonTraj.py, using the implemented EOMs to simulate photon trajectories and compare them with analytical solutions based on specific initial conditions. Did the video portion of lensing.py as well.
