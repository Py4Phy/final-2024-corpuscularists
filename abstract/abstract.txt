Gravitational Lensing For A Schwarzchild Black Hole Using Backward Ray Tracing

Ethan Pham, Jo Mama

  Black holes bend spacetime with enough potency that they can curve the paths of photons to an observeable degree. Their trajectories are found using the Euler-Lagrange equation after obtaining a solution to the Einstein Field Equations. The simplest solution is a spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, static (non-rotating) black hole, and taking the stress energy tensor to be zero (the vacuum solution). To simulate lensing from such a black hole, we established a plane at which the lensed image is observed, and then traced back rays from the plane, initializing the velocities of all of the rays to be normal to the plane. If the the backward-traced ray from a spot on the plane hit the initial image before the ray tracing concluded, then the pixel values for the color of the image at that point was assigned to the point on the plane which the ray originated from. Otherwise, the point on the plane which the ray originated from was set to be black. The rays were traced using an integrator which employs RK4 and dynamic time stepping. This was useful because the more time was spent along the trajectories where error was more prone, and increasing the time step where error was less prone. Comparing the simulation to other established simulations, along with the analytically known orbit solutions, our rays seem to be traced correctly. We also made videos of the black hole moving over images.
