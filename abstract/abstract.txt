Gravitational Lensing For A Schwarzchild Black Hole Using Backward Ray Tracing

Ethan Pham, Jo Mama

  Black holes bend spacetime, significantly curving the paths of photons. Their trajectories are found using the Euler-Lagrange equation after obtaining a solution to the Einstein Field Equations. The simplest solution is a spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, non-rotating, and has stress energy tensor of zero. To simulate this, we traced photons moving towards the black hole normally from a plane on the opposite sode of the black hole of an inital image. If the photon from a point hit the initial image, the point was set to the pixel values of where the photon hit the initial image. Otherwise, the point would be black. The rays were traced with an integrator using RK4 and dynamic time stepping. This was useful because the more time was spent along the trajectories when error was more prone, and increasing the time step where error was less prone. Comparing the simulation to other established simulations, along with the analytically known orbit solutions, our rays seem to be traced correctly.
